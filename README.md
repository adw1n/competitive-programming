My IDE of choice for algorithm competitions is Codeblocks 16. I use the prepare_workspace.sh script to automate creation of projects with my templates that I later use during competitions.


prepare-workspace script install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adw1n/competitive-programming ~/bin/competitive-programming/
sudo ln -s ~/bin/competitive-programming/prepare_workspace.sh /usr/local/bin/prepare-workspace
```

prepare-workspace script usage:
```bash
prepare-workspace --round 399 --codeforces
prepare-workspace --round 273 --topcoder
prepare-workspace --help
```


stl_cheat_sheet and additional_algorithms is what I have printed out and sometimes take to offline competitions.
